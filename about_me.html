            By the way, I am an average student on paper—but I am building my path in tech and business one step at a time. 
            I love working on projects that involve AI, Python, and creative apps like classifiers or games. I have also 
            launched my own home cleaning brand, Glowvery, which is a big learning journey in itself. I might come off as 
            quiet or introverted, but I am focused and curious. No <s>girlfriend</s> at the moment—just committed to my goals and 
            personal growth.
